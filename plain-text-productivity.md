# Plain Text Productivity

I have been following the personal productivity space since 2007, when I discovered David Allen's *Getting Things Done*.  And in those 13 years, I have bounced between more task management and personal productivity systems than I care to admit.  I started with a Franklin Covey planner in 2007, used Evernote for many years, used the Bullet Journal methodology for a couple of years, and even tried building my own workflow in Google's G Suite product.  While each one of those systems and processes worked in their own ways, I think I am just kind of burned out with trying to keep up with changing landscape of tools and apps.  I just want something simple, easily portable, and something I can personalize.

## The Move to Plain Text

There is only one tool that is truly simple, portable, and scalable... PLAIN TEXT.

Starting today, for the next two months, I am going to move my personal productivity system to a plain text system and test out how it works.  I am going to set it up with the goal of sticking with it for the long run, but I am just not going to move all of my historical information over until I am confident I like my new system and it is in a good spot.  So from July 1 to August 31, only new items are going to get put into the new system.  If all goes well, I will move over all historical lists, reference materials, etc. that can be supported in plain text format.
