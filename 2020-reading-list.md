# 2020 READING LIST

Below are the books I currently have on my reading wishlist (as of July 2020).  As I complete each book, I will mark them as completed and if the read was worth it, I may write up some quick thoughts about the things I learned.  All of them are downloaded onto my Kindle, and with vacation coming up in a couple fo weeks, I am sure I will get through several of them in the next few weeks.  The books are listed in no particular order.
